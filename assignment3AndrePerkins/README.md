DESCRIPTION:

A major annoyance when programming is trying to figure out if you have put the correct number of delimiters (parenthesis, brackets) in a piece of code. This usually leads to trying to manually count the number of opening and closing delimiters to make sure everything matches up. Your assignment for this week is to write a C++ program that uses a stack to analyze source code written in any language (C, C++, Lisp...you name it) and report the location of any mismatched delimiters. For this assignment, delimiters are defined to be: ( ) { } [ ] Note that the assignment is not asking you to find any other type of syntax errors. (You can tackle that in a compilers class.)
