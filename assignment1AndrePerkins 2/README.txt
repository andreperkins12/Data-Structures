DESCRIPTION:

For this assignment, you will build a simple analysis program that will compute basic statistics for a list of DNA strings. Your program should work as follows:-The program will accept as a command line argument the name of a text file that will contain an arbitrary list of DNA strings. (ie. ~/assign1/filename.txt) DNA strings consist of a sequence of nucleotides (A,C,T, or G). There will be 1 string per line of the file. No guarantees on capitalization.-The program will then compute the sum, mean, variance, and standard deviation of the length of the DNA strings in the list. It will also compute the relative probability of each nucleotide (A,C,T, or G), as well as the probability of each nucleotide bigram (AA, AC, AT, AG, CA, CC, CT, CG, etc) across the entire collection.-The program will output the labeled results to a file called yourname.out. At the top of the file, output your name, student id, etc.-After printing the summary statistics to yourname.out, you will generate 1000 DNA strings whose lengths follow a Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance as calculated above. The relative frequency of nucleotides will also follow the statistics calculated above. Append the 1000 strings to the end of yourname.out.-The program will then ask the user if they want to process another list.-If not, the program will exit. If so, the program will prompt for the name of the next file, process it, and append the results to the output file.
